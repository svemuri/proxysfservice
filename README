This application uses the spring rest framework to build a web application that implements the 3rd party rest api specification.
It implements two separate adapter instances.
1. salesforcessl - a relational instance that provides connectivity to salesforce rest api
2. proxyfileservice - a file system instance that returns file objects from a specified root directory. 

A useful tutorial on building a Hello World Rest application using the spring framework is available here.

SFController is the class that implements the rest end points.
The responses are returned as JSON by the framework, but we use standard java classes to represent them internally. 
CatalogResult.ListingResult : lists of schemas, table-names, or file-names.
CatalogResult.CatalogItem: represents a single item from a catalog.
CatalogResult.CollectionSchema: schema of a single table. It is nothing but an arraylist of ObjectSchemas.
QueryResult: represents the type for a QueryResult. It has a metadata field of type CollectionSchema, an arraylist of items i.e records of type Map<String,String> and an array list of LinkDescriptor to represent relationship links (only used for paged query results).


"/"
getDescription0() is the end point for the adapter metadata. The static adapter meta-data is provided from the file provider-instances.json

{instanceName}/{version}/Validate
This implements the method that validates user specified credentials. It is implemented by refreshing the authentication token with salesforce.

{instanceName}/{version}/metadata-catalog)
metadataCatalogRootQuery returns the top schemas. There is only one top schema "RESTADAPTER_SCHEMA" surfaced by this adapter.
The returned object type is ListingResult

"{instanceName}/{version}/metadata-catalog/{schemaName:.+}"
metadataCatalogListObjects is the method that returns a listing of objects under a specified schema.  
The returned object type is ListingResult.

 "{instanceName}/{version}/metadata-catalog/object-schema"
metadataCatalogGetObjectSchema() is the method that returns a description
of the schema of an object. The returned object type is CollectionSchema

"{instanceName}/{version}/metadata-catalog/list"
metadataCatalogGetFolderListing() is the method that returns the listing of folders under optionally a specified folder name (or the root folder if no containing folder is specified). The returned object type is ListingResult.

"{instanceName}/{version}"
downloadFile() is the method that returns a stream of records for a specified file from the file based instance. The returned type is a regular stream.

"{instanceName}/{version}/Query"
getQueryResult() is the method that executes a query with Salesforce and returns the result as a QueryResult object.
